            <h1>One Piece</h1>
            <p id="1"> <strong>One Piece</strong> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">manga</a> series written and illustrated by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda">Eiichiro Oda</a>. It has been serialized in
                Shueisha's shōnen
                manga magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump"><em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em></a>
                since July
                1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 101 tankōbon volumes as of December 2021. The story
                follows the
                adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally
                eating a Devil
                Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the
                world's ultimate
                treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>
            <p id="2">The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by
                Production I.G, and
                an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally,
                Toei has
                developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen television specials. Several companies
                have
                developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video
                games. The manga
                series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media
                and in
                Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an
                English-language
                release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation
                in 2007.

            <p id="3">One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has
                received many
                awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several
                volumes of the
                manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In
                2015, One
                Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a
                single
                author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only
                manga that
                had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the
                only that had
                achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes.</p>
            <p id="4">As of July 2021, One Piece had over 490 million copies in circulation in 58 countries and regions
                worldwide,
                making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book
                volume. It is
                also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>

    <h2>Premise</h2>
    <p>The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, whom, inspired by his childhood idol, the
        powerful
        pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One
        Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat
        Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off
        in
        search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator;
        Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a perverted but chivalrous chef. They acquire a ship, the Going
        Merry,[Jp 2] and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out
        on
        their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized
        reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright;
        Brook,
        a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of
        the
        Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship, the Thousand
        Sunny,[Jp 3] built by Franky. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations,
        revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and
        foes, as
        they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.</p>
