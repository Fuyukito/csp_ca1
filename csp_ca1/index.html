            <p id="3"><em>One Piece</em> has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has
                received many
                awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several
                volumes of the
                manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In
                2015, <em>One

                single
                author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only
                manga that
                had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the
                only that had

                a ship, the Going Merry,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-GMerry-3">[Jp 2]</a></sup> and
                engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out

            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p id="6">
                The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_piscine_and_amphibian_humanoids">fish-men</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merfolk">merfolk</a> (two races of
                fish/human hybrids), dwarves, minks (a race of humanoids with animal features), and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant">giants</a>. It is covered by two
                vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line,<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-RLine-5">[Jp 4]</a></sup> which is also the only
                continent in the world.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-6">[2]</a></sup> The Grand
                Line,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-GLine-7">[Jp 5]</a></sup> a sea that runs
                perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them
                into four seas: North Blue,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-NBlue-8">[Jp 6]</a></sup>
                East Blue,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-EBlue-9">[Jp 7]</a></sup> West
                Blue,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-WBlue-10">[Jp 8]</a></sup> and South
                Blue.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-SBlue-11">[Jp 9]</a><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-12">[3]</a></sup> Surrounding the Grand
                Line are two regions called Calm Belts,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-CBelt-13">[Jp
                        10]</a></sup> similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_latitudes">horse latitudes</a>, which
                experience almost no wind or ocean
                currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-SKing-14">[Jp 11]</a></sup> Because of this, the
                calm belts
                are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line.<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-15">[4]</a></sup> However, navy ships, members of an
                intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone <sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-SStone-16">[Jp 12]</a></sup> to mask their
                presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more
                dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal
                system known as Reverse Mountain.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-RMount-17">[Jp
                        13]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-18">[5]</a></sup> Sea water from each of
                the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at
                the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it
                compared to the second half.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-19">[6]</a></sup> The
                second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line,
                is known as the New World.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece#cite_note-NWorld-20">[Jp 14]</a><a
